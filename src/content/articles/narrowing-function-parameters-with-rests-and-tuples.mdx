# Narrowing Function Parameters With Rests And Tuples

TypeScript's provides several ways to describe the type of a function that can be called in multiple different ways.
But the two most common strategies -function overloads and generic functions- don't help much with how the function's internal implementation understands the types of its parameters.

This article will walk through three techniques for describing a parameter type that changes based on a previous parameter.
The first two allow using standard JavaScript syntax but aren't quite precise in describing the types inside the function.
The third one requires using a `...` array spread and `[...]` tuple type in a funky new way that gets the right types internally.

<!-- truncate -->

## Dependent Parameter Types? What?

Suppose you wanted to write a function that takes in two parameters:

- `fruit`: either `"apple"` or `"banana"`
- `info`: either...
  - an `AppleInfo` type if `fruit` is `"apple"`, or
  - a `BananaInfo` type if `fruit` is `"banana"`

In that function, the second parameter's type is different based on the first parameter.

An initial approach might be to declare the function's two parameters -`fruit` and `info`- as union types.
In short:

```ts
declare function logFruit(
  fruit: "apple" | "banana",
  info: AppleInfo | BananaInfo
): void;
```

That would allow calling the function with the right matched types, such as `"apple"` and an object matching `AppleInfo`.
That might look something like this:

```ts twoslash
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}

function logFruit(fruit: "apple" | "banana", info: AppleInfo | BananaInfo) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${(info as AppleInfo).color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(
        `My banana's curvature is ${(info as BananaInfo).curvature}.`
      );
      break;
  }
}

logFruit("apple", { color: "green" }); // Ok

logFruit("banana", { color: "green" }); // Should error, but doesn't...
```

Two problems in that code block:

- It requires manually `as` asserting `info` to the right type even when `fruit`'s type has been narrowed, such as within `case "apple"`.
- Nothing prevents calling `logFruit` with mismatched types, such as `"banana"` and an object matching `AppleInfo`.

The `logFruit` function needs a way to indicate that `info`'s type is dependent on the type of `fruit`.

## Using Function Overloads

One approach for describing a function as having multiple ways it can be called is with _function overloads_.
To recap function overloads, TypeScript allows code to describe any number of call signatures just before a function's implementation.
The function is then allowed to be called in ways matching any of those call signatures.

For example, this `eitherWay` can be called either with a `number` input to return a `number` or a `string` input to return a `string`:

```ts twoslash
function eitherWay(input: number): number;
function eitherWay(input: string): string;
function eitherWay(input: number | string) {
  return input;
}

eitherWay(123);
// ^?

eitherWay("abc");
// ^?
```

Describing the `logFruit` function with overloads -let's call it `logFruitOverload`- would look something like declaring a signature for `"apple"` and a signature for `"banana"`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2769
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}
// ---cut---
function logFruitOverload(fruit: "apple", info: AppleInfo): void;
function logFruitOverload(fruit: "banana", info: BananaInfo): void;
function logFruitOverload(
  fruit: "apple" | "banana",
  info: AppleInfo | BananaInfo
) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${(info as AppleInfo).color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(
        `My banana's curvature is ${(info as BananaInfo).curvature}.`
      );
      break;
  }
}

logFruitOverload("apple", { color: "green" }); // Ok

logFruitOverload("banana", { color: "green" }); // Should error
```

This function overloads approach does improve on the first one around union types:

- Calling `logFruitOverload` with `"apple"` permits passing an object matching `AppleInfo` as `info`.
- Calling `logFruitOverload` with `"banana"` and an `AppleInfo` object is a type error.

Progress!

But, the type of `info` inside the `case "apple":` is still `AppleInfo | BananaInfo`.
You can see this by hovering your cursor or mouse over the `info` in `info as AppleInfo`.
Explicit `as` assertions are still needed to access fruit-specific properties.

TypeScript isn't able to narrow the type of `info` even though the two overloads explicitly stated that each fruit string matched up with a specific interface.
The function's implementation signature -which is what its internal implementation respects- didn't understand the relationship.

## Using Generic Functions

Another attempt at type safety for this function might be to turn it generic.
The type of `info` depends on the type of `fruit`; therefore, using a type parameter for `fruit` would allow for narrowing the type of `info` based on the type of `fruit`.

This implementation declares a `Fruit` type parameter that must be one of the keys of an `InfoForFruit` interface (`"apple" | "banana"`), then declares that `info` must the corresponding `InfoForFruit` value under that `Fruit` key:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}
// ---cut---
interface InfoForFruit {
  apple: AppleInfo;
  banana: BananaInfo;
}

function logFruitGeneric<Fruit extends keyof InfoForFruit>(
  fruit: Fruit,
  info: InfoForFruit[Fruit]
) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${(info as AppleInfo).color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(
        `My banana's curvature is ${(info as BananaInfo).curvature}.`
      );
      break;
  }
}

logFruitGeneric("apple", { color: "green" }); // Ok

logFruitGeneric("banana", { color: "green" }); // Should error
```

This generic version gives a friendlier error message in the case of calling `logFruitGeneric` with `"banana"` and the wrong shape of info.
But TypeScript again unfortunately isn't able to narrow down the type of `info` inside `case "apple"`.

## Using Rest Parameters

For a third and final attempt, let's combine three pieces of syntax:

1. [Rest parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters): using a `...` to allow any number of parameters as an array
2. [Tuple types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types): restricting the type of an array to a fixed size, with an explicit type for element
3. [Array destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment): taking the elements in an array and assigning them to local variables

This `logFruitTuple` version uses those three techniques to allow passing in `fruit` and `info` parameters adhering to the `FruitAndInfo` tuple type:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}
// ---cut---
type FruitAndInfo = ["apple", AppleInfo] | ["banana", BananaInfo];

function logFruitTuple(...[fruit, info]: FruitAndInfo) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${info.color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(`My banana's curvature is ${info.curvature}.`);
      break;
  }
}

logFruitTuple("apple", { color: "green" }); // Ok

logFruitTuple("banana", { color: "green" }); // Should error
```

The function properly narrows `info`'s type based on `fruit`, and properly flags the incorrect call with `"banana"` and an `AppleInfo`-shaped object.
Hooray!

Step-by-step, here's how that parameter works:

1. `...` is a rest parameter, collecing any arguments may be passed to the function into an array
2. `[fruit, info]` collects the first two elements of that array, storing them in `fruit` and `info` variables, respectively
3. `: FruitAndInfo` annotates the type of the parameters to be `FruitAndInfo`, which is a union allowing either of the two tuples:
   - `["apple", AppleInfo]`
   - `["banana", BananaInfo]`

Putting it all together: the function accepts two parameters, and assigns them the type `FruitAndInfo` together.
That's exactly what we wanted!

### How It Works

TypeScript is smart enough that when elements of a tuple are narrowed, other elements of that same tuple are narrowed too.
That's why TypeScript knows that if `fruit` is an `"apple"` inside `logFruitTuple`, it can _narrow_ the type of `info` to `AppleInfo`.

You can isolate that smartness separately from function parameters.
In the following snippet, when the destructured `fruit` variable is narrowed to `"apple"`, `info` is narrowed to `AppleInfo`:

```ts twoslash
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}
// ---cut---
type FruitAndInfo = ["apple", AppleInfo] | ["banana", BananaInfo];

const [fruit, info]: FruitAndInfo = Math.random()
  ? ["apple", { color: "green" }]
  : ["banana", { curvature: 35 }];

if (fruit === "apple") {
  info;
  // ^?
}
```

`logFruitTuple`'s `[fruit, info]` parameter is typed as `FruitAndInfo`, so it benefits from the tuple types narrowing.
Smart.

### Named Tuples

> Thanks to [Emil van Galen on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmilVanGalen/status/1719622053769216013) for noting the usage of named tuples!

One downside of the tuples approach is that, by default, arguments do not have names.
The `logFruitTuple` function from earlier uses auto-generated `__0_0` and `__0_` when suggesting parameter names in editors:

```ts
logFruitTuple(__0_0: "apple", __0_1: AppleInfo): void
```

You can work around this naming behavior by assigning explicit names to the tuple type's elements.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}
// ---cut---
type FruitAndInfo =
  | [fruit: "apple", info: AppleInfo]
  | [fruit: "banana", info: BananaInfo];

function logFruitTupleNamed(...[fruit, info]: FruitAndInfo) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${info.color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(`My banana's curvature is ${info.curvature}.`);
      break;
  }
}
```

Putting `fruit:` and `info:` before each of the elements in the tuples will let TypeScript know to suggest those names in the function:

```ts
logFruitTuple(fruit: "apple", info: AppleInfo): void
```

See [Default rest parameter names to destructuring names when of an anonymous tuple](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/56289) on the TypeScript issue tracker for more details.

## Which Should You Use?

It depends.

Most of the time, these kinds of complex function signatures are a sign of overly complicated code.
Types that are difficult to represent in the type system can be difficult to work with because they can be conceptually complex.
When possible, try to avoid needing this kind of function signature.

### Technique Tradeoffs

If you must use one of these techniques, consider which one will cause your project's developer(s) the least pain in the future.
Many TypeScript developers prefer to avoid function overloads because of how wacky they appear at first glance.
Generic functions can also be intimidating to many TypeScript developers, though generally less so in cases such as this one that only have one type parameter.

`...` rest tuple parameters are a nifty trick that also run the risk of confusing developers.
But the increased type safety internally may be worth that confusion.
My recommendation would be to wait for a time that they're very well suited towards, try them out once, and see how they feel.
You may find that you like them or you may not.

Wrapping arguments in an array and then immediately destructuring that array also runs a small risk of hurting runtime performance if used in a very commonly run path.
Though, this performance hit is likely optimized to be zero or near-zero in most instances of the function.
Always diagnose runtime performance problems before jumping to conclusions.

### Alternative: Objects

Instead of wrestling with multiple function parameters, consider using a single object with multiple properties.
Doing so would allow using techniques such as the following [discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions) to represent different allowed shapes.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
interface AppleInfo {
  color: "green" | "red";
}

interface AppleAndInfo {
  fruit: "apple";
  info: AppleInfo;
}

interface BananaInfo {
  curvature: number;
}

interface BananaAndInfo {
  fruit: "banana";
  info: BananaInfo;
}

function logFruitTuple({ fruit, info }: AppleAndInfo | BananaAndInfo) {
  switch (fruit) {
    case "apple":
      console.log(`My apple's color is ${info.color}.`);
      break;
    case "banana":
      console.log(`My banana's curvature is ${info.curvature}.`);
      break;
  }
}

logFruitTuple({ fruit: "apple", info: { color: "green" } }); // Ok

logFruitTuple({ fruit: "banana", info: { color: "green" } }); // Should error
```

Whichever strategy you choose, remember to keep the code as readable and straightforward to understand as possible.
This quote from Brian Kerninghan applies to the type system as well as runtime code:

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
> Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

Happy typing!
