# Why Increase Your TSConfig `target`

TypeScript is a highly configurable language.
It comes with over a hundred compiler options that can be provided via the command-line to `tsc` and/or in a "TSConfig" configuration file (by default, `tsconfig.json`).

:::tip
TypeScript's compiler options are documented at [aka.ms/tsconfig](https://aka.ms/tsconfig).
:::

[`compilerOptions.target`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target) in particular can be an important configuration option for your project.
It specifies which ECMAScript version your project's output JavaScript code must support.

You can specify `target` in your TSConfig as the string name of an ECMAScript version, such as `"es5"`or`"es2021"`:

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2021"
  }
}
```

This article digs into what `target` influences and why that's useful.
Let's dig in!

:::info Recap
ECMAScript is the standard that JavaScript is based on.
Each year, a new version is released that adds features to the language.
Runtimes such as browsers and Node.js are constantly updating to support those newer features.
:::

## What TSConfig `target` Does

`target` influences three facets of how TypeScript interacts with your code:

1. If TypeScript is being used to transpile your source files to JavaScript, it specifies what syntax must be transpiled down to support older ECMAScript language versions.
2. Some syntax features are only allowed in newer targets.
3. [`compilerOptions.lib`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#lib) defaults to including global API type definitions corresponding to your target.

Let's cover each of those benefits in more detail.

### 1. Smaller Output JavaScript

Regardless of the transpiler you're using to generate JavaScript code, supporting relatively newer ECMAScript targets means your code will stay relatively more similar to its source.
Older ECMAScript targets necessitate transpiling newer JavaScript syntax down to equivalent older syntax.

Take the following async function written in JavaScript:

```js
async function valueAfterDelay(value, delay) {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  return value;
}
```

The equivalent runtime code for just that function -ignoring [`tslib` helpers](https://github.com/microsoft/tslib#tslib)- is much larger and much less readable:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
function valueAfterDelay(value, delay) {
    return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
        return __generator(this, function (_a) {
            switch (_a.label) {
                case 0: return [4 /*yield*/, new Promise(function (resolve) { return setTimeout(resolve, delay); })];
                case 1:
                    _a.sent();
                    return [2 /*return*/, value];
            }
        });
    });
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

That's a lot more code, and quite incomprehensible!
Choosing a newer target would make sure emitted JavaScript stays lean and readable.

### 2. Unlocked Newer Syntax

New forms of syntax added in newer ECMAScript versions generally try to be backwards-compatible with older ECMAScript versions via transpiling.
The previous `async function valueAfterDelay` code blocks are an example: they show `async` being turned into code runnable in very old environments.

Some newer forms of syntax, however, can't be transpiled down for support.
TypeScript will report a syntax error if you try to use one that can't be supported by your `target`.

Those syntax features include [property accessors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors) and [class `#` private identifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields):

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1056 18028
// @target: es3
const container = {
  get property() {
    return "hi!";
  },
};

class RandomBox {
  #value = Math.random();

  getValue() {
    return this.#value;
  }
}
```

Projects stuck on older ECMAScript targets can't use those nice new features.
When using a newer `target`, those syntax features are allowed by TypeScript's syntax checks.

### 3. Unlocked Lib Features

ECMAScript versions also often specify new APIs, such as methods on built-in classes.
TypeScript's [`lib` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#lib) allows you to specify what era of runtime ECMAScript features are supposed to be available when your code runs.
`lib` defaults to including DOM (browser) types along with the same year as your `compilerOptions.target`.

As an example, [`String.prototype.replaceAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll) is only natively available in ES2021 environments and newer.
Using it in a project with a `target` lower than `"es2021"` and the default `lib` would result in a TypeScript type error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2550
// compilerOptions.target: "es2017"
// (resulting in: compilerOptions.lib: ["dom", "es2017"])

let values = "abc abc abc";

values.replaceAll("a", "!");
```

By increasing `compilerOptions.target` to a value like `"es2022"` (which increases `lib` as a result), TypeScript recognizes that APIs such as `String.prototype.replaceAll` are available at runtime:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2550
// @lib: dom,esnext
// compilerOptions.target: "es2022"
// (resulting in: compilerOptions.lib: ["dom", "es2022"])

let values = "abc abc abc";

values.replaceAll("a", "!"); // ok
```

Note that is possible to [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) newer ECMAScript APIs into older environments.
[core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) is a popular library for JavaScript polyfills.

Some projects that use polyfills specify a `lib` higher than their `target` because they can rely on the APIs being polyfilled in.
TypeScript recognizes global API types corresponding to the `lib`:

```ts twoslash
// @lib: es2022
// @target: es2020
// compilerOptions.lib: ["es2022"]
// compilerOptions.target: "es2020"

let values = "abc abc abc";

values.replaceAll("a", "!"); // Ok
```

## `target` Might Not Impact Your Runtime Code

We should also note that TypeScript's `target` only impacts your runtime code if you're using TypeScript to transpile your source files to JavaScript.
If you're using another tool to transpile, such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io), [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io), or [SWC](https://swc.rs), then that tool's settings will be what determines the syntax used in your output JavaScript code.

Still, specifying `target` can still be useful. to including global type definitions corresponding to your `compilerOptions.target`.
If you're not customizing your `lib` compiler option, then specifying `target` can still impact with global APIs TypeScript recognizes you can use.

## Choosing a `target`

_Learning TypeScript_ recommends using the highest possible ECMAScript target supported by all the environment(s) your code will be run in.
In other words, you'll want to pick the oldest ECMAScript environment target that your code might run in - and no older.
Picking as new a `compilerOptions.target` as possible improve both the output code your users run and your development experience of using TypeScript.

The [kangax compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus) is an excellent tool for determining which features are supported in each environment.
It includes a list of all the runtime features added in each ECMAScript version, along with whether they're supported in many popular JavaScript environments.

### Browser Apps

As of 2023, the vast majority of browsers support at least **ES2021**, including:

- [Chrome >=99](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#chrome99) _(released March 2022)_
- [Edge >=99](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#edge99) _(released February 2022)_
- [Firefox >=98](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#firefox98) _(released March 2022)_
- [Safari >=15.2](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#safari15_2)\* _(released December 2021)_

<em>
  <small>
    *Safari &lt;16.4 lacks support for a couple of runtime API features, but
    they don't impact the type system or <code>target</code>.
  </small>
</em>
<br />
<br />

Unless you intentionally support older browsers, such as for corporate or education users, you can pick ES2021.

If you do need to support older browsers, consult the [kangax compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus) to see what ECMAScript features they support.

To check browser support for specific language features, many developers also like [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).
It can show which browser versions support that feature.
For example, [caniuse.com/?search=replaceAll](https://caniuse.com/?search=replaceAll) shows `String.prototype.replaceAll` as being available in Chrome/Edge (Desktop) 85, Safari (Mac) 13.1, Firefox 77, Opera 71, Chrome (Android) 111, and Safari (iOS) 13.4.

### Server Apps

As of 2023, the vast majority of servers also support at least **ES2021**.
That includes:

- [Deno 1.24](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#deno1_24)
- [Node 16.11](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/#node16_11) and newer supported versions of Node per the [Node release schedule](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases)

If you do need to run on older environments, consult the [kangax compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus) to see what ECMAScript features they support.

## Next Steps

By now, you've seen why a relatively recent `compilerOptions.target` is beneficial, as well as how to determine which target your code can run with _(most likely at least ES2021)_.
Knowing how to properly configure each compiler option in your TSConfig can help optimize your development flow and resultant application.
See [aka.ms/tsconfig](https://aka.ms/tsconfig) for the TSConfig full reference docs.

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // This should be enough for most projects.
    "target": "es2021"
  }
}
```
