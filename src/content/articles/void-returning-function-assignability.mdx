# Void-Returning Function Assignability

Most popular programming languages use the `void` keyword to indicate that a function cannot return a value.
_Learning TypeScript_ describes TypeScript's `void` keyword as indicating that the returned value from a function will be ignored.
Those two definitions are not always the same!
TypeScript's `void` comes with an initially surprising behavior: a function type with a non-`void` return is considered assignable to a function type with a `void` return.

```ts twoslash
let returnsVoid: () => void;

returnsVoid = () => "this is fine";
```

Why is that?

<!--truncate-->

## `void` Is More of an Idea

It's very common for functions to be called and have their return type ignored.
Take this code block, in which a function that returns `number` <small>(because Array's `.unshift` returns the new array length)</small> is passed to `.forEach`:

```ts twoslash
// @lib: dom,esnext
let letters = ["c", "d", "e"];

["a", "b"].forEach((letter) => letters.unshift(letter)); // Ok
```

We should be allowed to write that code in TypeScript!
`.forEach`'s function parameter's return type is correctly marked as `void` because the value returned from the function is ignored.
**Functions that return a value can be used in locations that don't care about their returned value.**

## `void` is not `any`

Note that TypeScript will not allow you to return a value within a function explicitly annotated as returning `void`.
TypeScript will report an assignability type error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
function thisIsNotFine(): void {
  return "ðŸ”¥";
  // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'void'.
}
```

`void` is not a free pass to return whatever you want.
It's an explicit indication that no return value is meant to be used.

## Addendum: Misused Promises

Indeed, it is!
Passing an asynchronous function (one that returns a Promise) to a handler that doesn't handle the created Promise means Promise rejections might not be handled.
This frequently shows up with event listeners in UI libraries such as React:

```tsx twoslash
// @lib: dom,esnext
async function myOnClick() {
  // (simulate some asynchronous work happening)
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

  // (simulate some crashing bug in the code)
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    throw new Error("Oh no!");
  }
}

// The "Oh no!" Error won't be logged anywhere or handled...
const myButton = <button onClick={myOnClick}>...</button>;
```

[TypeScript ESLint](https://typescript-eslint.io)'s [no-misused-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-misused-promises) rule can catch cases like this automatically for you.
The [no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises) rule is also useful for catching other classes of "floating" Promises.
