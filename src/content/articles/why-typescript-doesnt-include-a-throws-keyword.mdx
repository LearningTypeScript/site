# Why TypeScript Doesn't Include a `throws` Keyword

One long-requested feature for TypeScript is the ability for its types to describe what exceptions a function might throw.
"Throw types", as the feature is often called, are used in some programming languages to help ensure developers call functions safely.

The popular strongly typed language Java, for example, implements throw types with a `throws` keyword.
Without reading any other code, a developer would infer from the following first line of a `positive` function that the function is able to throw a `ValueException`:

```java
public static void positive(int value) throws ValueException { /* ...*/ }
```

Throw types are also useful for developer tooling.
They can tell compilers when a function call might throw an exception without safe `try`/`catch` handling.

That all seems useful, so why doesn't TypeScript include throw types?

In short, doing so wouldn't be feasible for TypeScript -- and some would argue isn't practical in most programming languages.
This blog post will dig into the benefits, drawbacks, and general blockers to including throw types in TypeScript.
Let's dig in!

## Benefits of Throw Types

Developers generally prefer to know when a function might throw an exception, along with which types of exceptions.
Describing a function's exceptions alongside its parameter and return types can act as useful documentation for developers.
Throw types also allow a language's type checker to warn when a function is called without appropriate error handling.

For example, if the `Assert.positive` Java method from earlier were to be used in a method that doesn't handle that case, Java would know to report a compilation error:

```java
public void example() {
  Assert.positive(2);
  //            ~
  // Error: unreported exception ValueException; must be caught or declared to be thrown.
}
```

Another way of thinking about thrown exceptions is that they describe a second return type for a function.
Functions may either return a value or throw an error.
Traditional type annotations annotate the former; throw types document the latter.

In theory, documenting potential exceptions sounds like a lovely way to satisfy the [Principle of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment): that behaviors in a system shouldn't surprise users.
Explicitly marking the types of potential exceptions a function may throw reduces potential surprise when the function throws.

### Checked Exceptions

Throw types are often used alongside a feature called "checked exceptions", where `catch` clauses are able to annotate the type(s) of exceptions they might catch.
Languages such as Java allow adding a type annotation alongside caught exceptions to run logic specific to the type of thrown exception.

This hypothetical Java code runs specific logic for caught `ValueException`s, and falls back to more general logic for other `Exception`s:

```java
public void example() {
  try {
    Assert.positive(-1);
  } catch (ValueException error) {
    System.out.println("Incorrect value: " + error.value);
  } catch (Exception error) {
    System.out.println("General error: " + error.message);
  }
}
```

Checked exceptions are a handy tool for running different logic based on the type of a thrown exception.
Strongly typed languages like Java are able to enforce the correct `catch` block is run based on the type of the caught exception.

## Barriers to Throw Types

In practice, there are quite a few reasons why throw types aren't feasible in the TypeScript language.
These range from what's practically possible given common JavaScript practices up through difficulties of truly representing throw types in the type system.

### Unchecked Untyped Exceptions

It is an unfortunate reality in coding that most lines of code can throw all sorts of errors unexpectedly.
Even seemingly type-safe code can sometimes mysteriously throw an error, including Object getters and setters.

For example, setting [the `length` of an `Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) to a negative or too-large number will throw a [`RangeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RangeError):

```ts twoslash
[].length = -1;
// Runtime error thrown: "RangeError: Invalid array length"
```

User-defined getters and setters may throw errors too.
The following `Counter` class intentionally is able to throw errors in its `count` property's getter:

```ts twoslash
class Counter {
  #counted = 0;

  get count() {
    if (!this.#counted) {
      throw new Error("Not ready yet.");
    }

    return this.#counted;
  }

  increment() {
    this.#counted += 1;
  }
}

const { count } = new Counter();
// Runtime error thrown: "Error: Not ready yet."
```

Even worse, JavaScript doesn't guarantee thrown objects to be instances of its built-in `Error` class!
The following code, horrifyingly, throws one of four types, two of which are not `Error` instances:

```ts twoslash
function thisIsValidTypeScript() {
  switch (Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)) {
    case 0:
      throw new RangeError("Zero?!");
    case 1:
      throw new Error("Gotcha!");
    case 2:
      throw "a primitive string, not an Error";
    case 3:
      throw null;
  }
}
```

:::tip
The [`plugin:@typescript-eslint/only-throw-error`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/only-throw-error) lint rule can enforce writing code that only ever throws `Error`s.
However, it only looks at your own code, not the code of any dependencies.
:::

As a result, TypeScript can't predict the type of errors in `catch` clauses.
It has to assume a "top" type (a type that allows any other type): namely `any` by default, or the safer `unknown` when [`useUnknownInCatchVariables`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#useUnknownInCatchVariables) is enabled.

TypeScript code in `catch` blocks must therefore use type assertions and/or runtime type checks to type narrow the types of caught errors.

```ts
try {
  thisIsValidTypeScript();
} catch (error) {
  if (error) {
    if (error instanceof RangeError) {
      console.warn("Out of range:", error.message);
    } else if (error instanceof Error) {
      console.warn("Caught an Error:", error.stack);
    } else {
      console.warn("Caught a non-Error:", error);
    }
  } else {
    console.error("I don't even know what this is:", error);
  }
}
```

In other words, even if functions could have throw types, their exceptions' types would effectively still be `unknown`.
Throw types are much less useful in runtimes like JavaScript's that can't enforce checked exception types.

### Ecosystem Inertia

JavaScript and TypeScript developers don't have an existing culture of documenting their functions' potential exceptions.
There's no standard for which types of function calls or failure cases should be represented by exceptions and/or a well-crafted return type.
As a result, although many non-TypeScript packages have well-designed value return types, their potential throw types are surprisingly complex.

Compounding this issue is the JavaScript community's propensity for creating many small packages built on top of each other.
Each of the packages in a project's dependency tree may have different approaches to error handling.
Filling out throw types for many third-party packages would be a huge task, regardless of whether it would benefit TypeScript developers.

### Lack of Need

Older languages like Java were created with thrown exceptions in part because they didn't support more rich language features such as union types.
Methods meant to either result in an `Exception` or some `Value` couldn't return the union of `Exception | Value`.
Instead, they would often use value returns for the "happy" path (`Value`) and thrown exceptions for the "unhappy" path (`Exception`).

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a much more flexible language than many traditional strongly-typed languages.
JavaScript and TypeScript include several features that make "happy" and "unhappy" path management easier, including the ones described later in [Preferred Alternatives](#preferred-alternatives):

- [First-class functions](#first-class-functions): providing inline functions that can be provided multiple parameters
- [Union types](#union-types): allowing returned values to match one of several possible shapes

Nowadays, many JavaScript and TypeScript developers prefer using those languages' flexible features to avoid throwing exceptions.
In doing so, they've lessened the frequency with which their code throws exceptions, lessening the need for throw types or checked exceptions.

### Type System Complexity

Every addition to the TypeScript language increases the complexity of its type system.
Throw types would need to also be factored into the type checker's assignability checks for function types.
However, being able to define throw types that don't excessively report on valid code is tricky.

Take the case of Object getters and setters potentially throwing errors.
It would be very inconvenient for developers if setting the `length` property of an Array always necessitated adding a throws type.
But, TypeScript doesn't have the ability to represent numerics types more precise than `number`.
There'd be no way in the type system to know which numeric values would be at risk of triggering an error.

Additional tricky type system questions include:

- How should interface and object type properties indicate they may throw errors?
- If code isn't annotated as throwing an exception, should adding a `try` block around it still be allowed?
- How should type annotations indicate that a function's parameter may be a function that can throw errors, but those won't be raised to calling code? (e.g. [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout))

TypeScript adding throws types would necessitate developers learning those answers in order to effectively write type-safe functions with throw types.
Even if the answers are straightforward, that's still added complexity to what developers need to understand to write TypeScript code.

## Preferred Alternatives

When working in a typed language such as TypeScript, it's useful to design code in ways that can be modeled by the language's type system.
Doing so allows the type system to better understand the code and provide more assistance to developers using it.

### First-Class Functions

JavaScript is known in part for its support for "first-class functions": meaning new functions may be provided as values for function arguments and variables.
Many APIs developed in JavaScript chose to use first-class functions instead of throwing exceptions.

For example, the [Node.js `fs.readFile` API](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) designed before JavaScript Promises have developers provide a function to be called on completion.
The function is called with two parameters, `err` and `data`, only one of which will be provided a value:

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";

fs.readFile("data.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Oh no:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("Got data:", data.toString());
  }
});
```

Many traditional strongly typed languages either never supported inline first-class functions or only recently started to.
First-class functions are a handy way to allow multiple result types.

### Union Types

JavaScript allows functions to return any number of different data types.
TypeScript represents values that could be one of several possible types with union types.

Instead of the possibility of a function throwing an `Error`, TypeScript developers might switch it to instead return either an `Error` or a `Value`.

Consider the following `getValueMaybe` function that either returns a `Value` or throws an `Error`:

```ts twoslash
interface Value {
  /* ... */
}

declare function createValue(): Value;
declare function readyForValues(): Boolean;

function getValueMaybe() {
  if (!readyForValues()) {
    throw new Error("Wait!");
  }

  const value: Value = {
    /* ... */
  };

  return value;
}

try {
  const value = getValueMaybe();
  console.log("Got a value:", value);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Not ready to get value:", error);
}
```

One refactor of the `getValueMaybe` function might have it return `Value | Error`, where the `Error` type indicates it wasn't able to run yet.
TypeScript's type system would then enforce that code handle the `Error` case instead of assuming the returned value is an `Value`:

```ts twoslash
declare function createValue(): Value;
declare function readyForValues(): Boolean;

interface Value {
  /* ... */
}

// ---cut---

function getValueMaybe() {
  return readyForValues() ? createValue() : new Error("Wait!");
}

const value = getValueMaybe();

if (value instanceof Error) {
  console.error("Not ready to get value:", value);
} else {
  console.log("Got a value:", value);
}
```

Other common union type returns include `Value | undefined`, where `undefined` indicates there's no `Value` to be had, or a [discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions).

### Precise Ready States

A more comprehensive refactor might try to eliminate the possibility of calling a function when it might throw an error.
Savvy TypeScript developers might prefer the previous `createValue()` function not be made available until its `readyForValues()` would be `true`.

A refactor might wrap the `createValue()` function in an asynchronous "factory" that only returns the function once it's ready to be called:

```ts twoslash
// @lib: dom,esnext
// @module: nodenext
// @target: esnext
export interface Value {
  /* ... */
}

// ---cut---

async function getValueCreator() {
  // (wait until the value is ready to be created)

  return function createValue() {
    const value: Value = {
      /* ... */
    };
    return value;
  };
}

const createValue = await getValueCreator();

const value = await createValue();

console.log("Got a value:", value);
```

Not all code can be refactored to an alternate strategy such as factory functions.
But, when possible, factory functions can help make code more natural to work in and avoid error states altogether.

Regardless of which strategy you're able to choose, it's preferable to use one that can be represented cleanly in your language's type system.

## Closing Thoughts

Throw types seem like a useful idea at first, and do have some use in helping developers write safer code.
But especially in a more dynamic ecosystem like JavaScript's, their drawbacks outweigh their potential positives.
Adding them to the TypeScript ecosystem would be a large amount of work for much less benefit than in less flexibly-typed ecosystems.

If you'd like to achieve more safe, predictable function calls, consider using an alternate strategy.
Several lovely alternatives are available in TypeScript, including first-class functions and union types.

### Further Reading

Ryan Cavanaugh, the development lead for TypeScript, posted a [thorough explanation comment of why TypeScript doesn't have throw types](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13219#issuecomment-1515037604) on the TypeScript issue tracker.
This blog post is a simplified regurgitation of some of the points made in that comment.

Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C# and TypeScript, discussed problems with checked exceptions in [this interview with Bill Venners and Bruce Eckel](https://www.artima.com/articles/the-trouble-with-checked-exceptions).

The TypeScript [`useUnknownInCatchVariables` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#useUnknownInCatchVariables) is useful for ensuring safe usage of caught errors.
