# Comment Directives

A _comment directive_ is a _comment_ that _directs_ (changes) how a tool operates within a file.
TypeScript includes several comment directives that can change type checking behavior for a file or on a specific line.

One comment directive sometimes used in TypeScript files is `// @ts-expect-error`, which suppresses type checking for a single line:

```ts twoslash
// @ts-expect-error
let value: number = "oops!";
```

Wanting to ignore type errors might seem counterintuitive at first.
If a project already decided to use TypeScript, why disable type checking?

Rare cases do exist when TypeScript's type checking needs to be suppressed in a small area of code.
Comment directives can be helpful for those rare cases to get around the type checker.

This article will explain the kinds of comment directives supported by TypeScript: why they exist, what they do, and how to use them.

## TypeScript's Comment Directives

TypeScript's type checker is not always correct.
There are rare edge cases when its understanding of types in code doesn't perfectly match reality.
For example:

- Type definitions outside of your control might not be correct
- Writing the correct types for some area of code might be too time consuming at the moment
- There might be a transient bug or missing feature in TypeScript itself that prevents it from fully understanding code as written

In rare cases such as those, it can be necessary as a last-ditch resort to ignore a type error reported by TypeScript.
TypeScript provides two comment directives that can ignore a type error on a line: `// @ts-expect-error` and `// @ts-ignore`.

### `@ts-expect-error`

`// @ts-expect-error` is a comment directive that tells TypeScript to ignore any type errors on the next line of code.
It's made to be used when TypeScript would report a type error even though code is written correctly.

Suppose you know a global `process` function exists that should take in a `string` parameter, but its types incorrectly describe it as taking in `number`.
If you were to call `process` with a value of type `string`, TypeScript would report a type error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345

declare function process(data: number): void;

process("abc");
```

In this case, you know that TypeScript is wrong to report a type error on `process("abc")`.
It's the types that are incorrect -- not the runtime code.
You need a way to direct TypeScript to ignore that line.

Adding a `// @ts-expect-error` comment directive before the offending line would remove the type error:

```ts twoslash
declare function process(data: number): void;

// @ts-expect-error
process("abc"); // No type error ✅
```

:::caution
It is almost always better to correct type definitions rather than use comment directives.
[Avoiding Comment Directives](#avoiding-comment-directives) covers several preferable strategies.
:::

`// @ts-expect-error` is only meant to be used before lines that have a TypeScript type error.
If the line after the comment does not have a type error, then TypeScript will report a new type error on the unnecessary `// @ts-expect-error`.

If, say, the `process` function's types were to be corrected to indicate `data` is type `string`, then `process("abc")` would no longer contain a type error.
TypeScript would then report that any preceding `// @ts-expect-error` is unnecessary.
Once a `// @ts-expect-error` comment directive is unnecessary, you can delete it.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2578
declare function process(data: string): void;

// @ts-expect-error
process("abc"); // No type error ✅
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts twoslash
declare function process(data: string): void;

process("abc"); // No type error ✅
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `@ts-ignore`

`// @ts-ignore` is the same as `// @ts-expect-error`, but it is allowed to exist even if it doesn't suppress an existing type error.
A `// @ts-ignore` above a line with no type errors will not trigger TypeScript to report a type error.

The following example places a `// @ts-ignore` above a `process("abc")` line containing no type errors.
TypeScript would not produce a new type error for the unnecessary comment directive:

```ts twoslash
declare function process(data: string): void;

// @ts-ignore
process("abc");
```

There are very few times when `// @ts-ignore` should be used instead of `// @ts-expect-error`.
Using `// @ts-expect-error` instead of `// @ts-ignore` ensures TypeScript will report when a comment directive is no longer needed.
Unnecessary comment directives are misleading and take up space.

:::tip
[Choosing the Right Comment Directive](#choosing-the-right-comment-directive) covers the rare cases when `// @ts-ignore` is preferable over `// @ts-expect-error`.
:::

### `@ts-nocheck`

Many TypeScript projects are written completely or mostly with TypeScript syntax and are fully type checked.
However, some TypeScript projects contain JavaScript files that haven't been structured in ways that are type-safe.
Attempting to run type checking on files in those projects can sometimes result in many erroneous type errors.

Suppose a `utilities.js` file defines and exports a `weaklyTyped` object whose types are inferred incorrectly by TypeScript.
Each usage of that `weaklyTyped` object in another file, `index.ts`, might incur a type error:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="index.ts">

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
// @checkJs
// @filename: utilities.js
export const weaklyTyped = {};
// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { weaklyTyped } from "./utilities.js";

weaklyTyped.log("Hello");
weaklyTyped.log("world");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="utilities.js">

```ts twoslash
// TODO: Convert to TypeScript
export const weaklyTyped = {};

Object.assign(weaklyTyped, {
  log: console.log.bind(console),
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

TypeScript provides a `// @ts-nocheck` comment directive that disables type checking for an entire file.
Placing `// @ts-nocheck` at the top of a file stops TypeScript from reporting any type errors on the file.

Adding a `// @ts-check` at the top of the `index.ts` file would prevent TypeScript from reporting type errors from using `weaklyTyped`:

```ts twoslash
// @filename: utilities.js
export const weaklyTyped = {};
// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
// @ts-nocheck
import { weaklyTyped } from "./utilities.js";

weaklyTyped.log("Hello"); // No type error ✅
weaklyTyped.log("world"); // No type error ✅
```

:::caution
`// @ts-nocheck` is even more unsafe than `// @ts-expect-error` and `// @ts-ignore`.
It should only be used as a stopgap until files are refactored to have proper types.
:::

### `@ts-check`

`// @ts-check` is the opposite of `// @ts-ignore`: instead of disabling type checking for a file, it _enables_ type checking for the file.
This can be useful in projects where TypeScript sees JavaScript files with the [`allowJs` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowJs) and doesn't type check them with [`checkJs` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#checkJs).
Placing `// @ts-check` at the top of a JavaScript file allows easing into type checking for just that file - without enabling type checking on all files.

Take the following `index.js` file as an example.
With TypeScript set to `allowJs`, it wouldn't have a type error reported for passing a `string` argument to a function parameter of type `number`.
But with `// @ts-check`, that type error would be reported:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Without // @ts-check">

```ts twoslash title="index.js"
// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
/** @param {number} value */
function double(value) {
  return value * 2;
}

console.log(double(1));
console.log(double("2")); // Should be a type error, but isn't ❌
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="With // @ts-check">

```ts twoslash title="index.js"
// @errors: 2345
// @filename: index.js
// ---cut---
// @ts-check
/** @param {number} value */
function double(value) {
  return value * 2;
}

console.log(double(1));
console.log(double("2"));
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

Comment directives are an "escape hatch": they allow switching small parts of a project to different type checking behavior.
Escape hatches should be used with extreme caution and only when they are absolutely necessary.

### Avoiding Comment Directives

If at all possible, don't use comment directives to suppress type errors.

Comment directives are a blunt instrument: they apply to an entire area of code.
There is no way to specify a specific type error to target in comment directives.

Suppressing type errors with comment directives is a "bandaid" fix: it doesn't address whatever root issue caused the incorrect type error to begin with.
When possible, it's better to improve TypeScript's understanding of code.

Consider trying the following strategies for fixing types before falling back to a comment directive.

#### Correcting Incorrect Types

If you know the types for code are incorrect, the best outcome is generally to fix those types.
That includes `declare` statements as well as `.d.ts` files in your project and in dependencies.

In the `process` example from earlier, a `// @ts-expect-error` was used because the the declared type for `process` was incorrect.
The `// @ts-expect-error` was no longer necessary once the type for `process` was fixed.
Good!

If your project uses types from community-authored `@types/` packages published by [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), you may find incorrect definitions within your `node_modules/`.
Those can be fixed at the source by sending a pull request to DefinitelyTyped.
Doing so will fix the types for your project -- as well as for any other consumers of that package.

:::tip
The [`patch-package` package](https://npmjs.com/package/patch-package) applies changes to `node_modules/` packages.
You can use it to apply changes locally from in-progress DefinitelyTyped pull requests.

#### Refactoring for Type Safety

#### Type Assertions

### Choosing The Right Comment Directive

{/* `// @ts-expect-error` or `// @ts-ignore`? */}

### Comment Directive Explanations

Comment directives such as `// @ts-expect-error` can also include more text.
TypeScript developers will often use this to include explanations for the comment directive.
Comment directive explanations are generally considered a best practice, so readers of the code understand why the comment directive is necessary.

This expanded comment from before explains the context for why `process`'s types are wrong:

```ts twoslash
declare function process(data: number): void;

// @ts-expect-error -- Pending 'process' being fixed to take in string.
process("abc"); // No type error ✅
```

Including explanations with comment directives is a good practice to adhere to.
In addition to explaining the _"why"_ of the comment directive, they hint to future code authors to think on and explain any comment directive they might want to add.

### Linting Comment Directives

[`@typescript-eslint/ban-comment`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-ts-comment) can be used to enforce best practices with TypeScript's comment directives.
By default, the rule:

- Always reports on `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` comment directives
- Reports on `@ts-expect-error` directives that don't have an explanatory comment description
- Requires explanatory comment descriptions contain at least 3 characters

For example, suppose `"@example/package"` exports a `process` function that should take in a `string` but whose types incorrectly indicate take in a `number`.
A `// @ts-expect-error` comment could be used to tell TypeScript to ignore the line:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
import { process } from "@example/package";

// @ts-ignore
process("New York City");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
import { process } from "@example/package";

// @ts-expect-error -- pending updating the process types
process("New York City");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Teams using issue trackers such as GitHub Issues or Jira will often prefer to include links to tracking tickets in todo comments.
Doing so can help ensure the reason for the comment gets documented more fully, and isn't forgotten about later.

[`@typescript-eslint/ban-comment`'s `descriptionFormat` option](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-ts-comment#descriptionformat) can be used to enforce comments align to a certain format.
Teams can use that to enforce the explanation for a comment directive includes a link to a tracking issue.

For example, given the following ESLint config, comment directives must include a `-- TODO(GH-*)` linking to an issue:

```ts
export default tseslint.config({
  // ...
  rules: {
    "@typescript-eslint/ban-comment": [
      "error",
      {
        descriptionFormat: "^ -- TODO\\(GH-\\d+\\)",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="❌ Incorrect">

```ts
import { process } from "@example/package";

// @ts-expect-error -- pending updating the process types
process("New York City");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="✅ Correct">

```ts
import { process } from "@example/package";

// @ts-expect-error -- TODO(GH-1234): pending updating the process types
process("New York City");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

See [typescript-eslint's Getting Started guide](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started) to enable `@typescript-eslint/ban-comment` and other recommended rules.

Equivalent lint rules in other common linters are:

- Biome: [`nursery/noTsComment`](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/713)
- Deno: [`ban-ts-comment`](https://lint.deno.land/rules/ban-ts-comment)
- Oxlint: [`typescript/ban-ts-comment`](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules/typescript/ban-ts-comment.html)

## Comment Directives in Other Tools

TypeScript is not the only static analysis tool that allows inline configuration comments.
Formatters, linters, and others often include their own comment directives that operate separately from TypeScript.

### Formatter Comment Directives

Popular web formatters such as [Biome's](https://biomejs.dev/formatter/#ignore-code "Biome > Formatter > Ignore Code"), [`deno fmt`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/fmt/#ignoring-code "deno fmt > Ignoring Code"), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/ignore#javascript "Prettier > Ignoring Code > JavaScript") all support comment directives that disable formatting within a file.
For example, the following line taken from the Prettier documentation shows `// prettier-ignore` excluding a line from being formatted by Prettier:

```js
matrix(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1);

// prettier-ignore
matrix(
  1, 0, 0,
  0, 1, 0,
  0, 0, 1
)
```

Formatter comment directives don't change the behavior of TypeScript's type checker.

### Linter Comment Directives

Popular web linters such as [Biome's](https://biomejs.dev/linter/#ignore-code "Biome > Linter > Ignore code"), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-rules "ESLint > Configure > Rules > Disabling Rules"), [`deno lint`](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/lint/#line-level "Deno > Linter > Ignore directives > Line level"), and [`oxlint`](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html#features "Oxc > Linter (oxlint) > Features")
Linters such as ESLint have their own comment directives that can reconfigure the linter on a per-file or per-line basis.

For example, the following line demonstrates disabling the `no-console` ESLint rule for a line:

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Linters are not the same tools as type checkers.
Linter comment directives don't change the behavior of TypeScript's type checker.

- [ESLint > Blog > Differences between ESLint and TypeScript](ps://eslint.org/blog/2025/01/differences-between-eslint-and-typescript)
- [typescript-eslint > FAQs > Why aren't // @ts-expect-error or // @ts-ignore comments affecting lint results?](https://typescript-eslint.io/troubleshooting/faqs/typescript#why-arent--ts-expect-error-or--ts-ignore-comments-affecting-lint-results)

## Closing Thoughts

Comment directives are a "necessary evil" for static analysis tools such as TypeScript.
They provide an occasionally-useful escape hatch to write code that the type checker would not otherwise permit.
Try to avoid comment directives if possible, and instead write code that works well with the type checker.

If you must use a comment directive, be sure to choose the appropriate one.
Consider using a lint rule such as [`@typescript-eslint/ban-comment`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/ban-ts-comment) to enforce directives be explained.
