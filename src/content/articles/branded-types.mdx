# Branded Types

TypeScript's type system allows any two types that seem to have the same structure to be assignable to each other.
But what if we want to restrict a type to only allow certain values, even if other values happen to have the same structure?
Say, marking a difference between sanitized and un-sanitized strings, or positive integers from all numbers?

This need is solvable with a pattern called _"branded types"_, sometimes also called _"opaque types"_.
Let's dive into why one might want to use branded types, how to declare and use them, and some alternatives to the pattern.

<!-- truncate -->

## Branding Needs

TypeScript's type system doesn't always provide a way to differentiate types that seem to be structurally the same.
For example, some values in application might need to work only with positive numbers.
Assigning any number that isn't known to be zero or positive should be a type error:

```ts
declare function waitForSeconds(seconds: number): Promise<void>;

async function waitThenLog(seconds: number) {
  // This should not be an error. üëç
  await waitForSeconds(seconds);

  // This should be an error: -1 is not positive. üëé
  await waitForSeconds(-1);

  console.log("Done!");
}
```

TypeScript doesn't have a built-in way to describe positive numbers, but being able to indicate them in the type system could still be useful.
In other words, we need a way to _"brand"_ (mark) some number as being not just any old number, but specifically the type we want.

### Introducing Branded Types

A _"branded type"_ is one that is the same as an existing type, but with some extra type system property that doesn't actually exist at runtime.
That _"brand"_ property is used to differentiate the two types in the type system.

As an example, we could declare a branded type for positive numbers by declaring a `Positive` type that is both a `number` and an object with a never-used `__brand` property.
The values we'll later use as `Positive`s won't actually have a `__brand` value -- this property is just in the type system.

We can then use that `Positive` branded type in place of `number` for any location that should only ever receive a positive number:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
type Positive = number & { __brand: "positive" };

declare function waitForSeconds(seconds: Positive): Promise<void>;

async function waitThenLog(seconds: Positive) {
  // This should not be an error: seconds are being used. üëç
  await waitForSeconds(seconds);

  // Now, this errors as we'd expect it to. üëç
  await waitForSeconds(-1);

  console.log("Done!");
}
```

By marking our numbers as the `Positive` type, we indicated to TypeScript that non-positive numbers shouldn't be used in their place.
In doing so we achieved more safety in our code -- at the cost of writing a few more types.

Branded types are a useful lie to the type system: our positive numbers will never actually have that `__brand` property.
We're just making sure that no developer accidentally provides a value of a non-branded type to a location that requires one that is branded.

:::note
Per [Microsoft/TypeScript#202 Support some non-structural (nominal) type matching](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/202), TypeScript doesn't have built-in support for branded types.
_"Nominal"_ typing is the term for types that might have similar runtime structures but are treated differently in the type system -- such as branded types.
:::

## Branding Values

The previous code showed passing around values that are already known to be a branded type.
But how do we tell the type system that some new value is a branded type?

Creating a new value that is used as a branded type generally requires asserting to TypeScript that the value does, in fact, satisfy the branded type's guarantees.
This is often done in one of two ways: with an `as` assertion or with a utility function.

### `as` Assertions

Type assertions are a way of telling TypeScript something it wouldn't be able to know from code on its own.
In the case of branded values, `as` can be used to tell TypeScript that a value is intended to be an instance of a branded type.

The following snippet uses an `as` assertion to tell TypeScript that the `123` is, in fact, a `Positive`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
type Positive = number & { __brand: "positive" };

let myPositive: Positive;

// Ok: the assertion tells TypeScript we meant this. üëç
myPositive = 123 as Positive;

// Type error: TypeScript doesn't know whether this is intended. üëç
myPositive = 123;
```

By using an `as` assertion, the code told TypeScript that the `123` value should be considered a `Positive`.
Notice that no `__brand` property was ever assigned at runtime.
The `as` assertion told TypeScript to assume it exists.

Using `as` assertions for branded types is a convenient way to quickly assert a value to be a branded type.
Unfortunately, `as` assertions can bypass type errors in cases where the developer might not be correct.
The previous code could have written something blatantly incorrect, like `-1 as Positive`, and TypeScript would have been none the wiser.

Be very careful whenever using `as` assertions in TypeScript.

### Type Predicates

Instead of writing `as` assertions to create new instances of branded types, it's often safer -though more laborious- to use functions that validate values before they can be considered instances of branded types.

_"Type predicates"_ are functions whose return type indicates whether a parameter `is` a particular type.
Although they return a `boolean` value at runtime, the type system knows to apply type narrowing based on the returned value.

Type predicates can be used to return whether a parameter `is` a particular branded type.

This `isPositive` returns a `boolean` indicating whether `value is Positive`.
That means inside of the following `if (isPositive(value)) {`, TypeScript knows the `value` is of type `Positive`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
type Positive = number & { __brand: "positive" };

function isPositive(value: number): value is Positive {
  return value > 0;
}

let myPositive: Positive;

let value = 123;
//  ^?

if (isPositive(value)) {
  // Ok: the type predicate tells TypeScript we meant this. üëç
  myPositive = value;
  //           ^?
}

// Type error: TypeScript doesn't know whether this is intended. üëç
myPositive = 123;
```

Type predicates can be useful for safely gating some logic on whether a value matches a branded type's intent.
But, keep in mind that type predicates aren't much more type-safe than an `as` assertion.
TypeScript doesn't check whether the logic of a type predicate matches up to a branded type's intent.
It leaves that up to the code author.

### Assertion Functions

Another downside of type predicate functions is that they require writing conditional wrappers in code (the `if (isPositive) { ... }`).
Those `if`s take up more space and add more runtime logic than `as` assertions.

To make our code a little more readable, we can extract a utility function known as a _"type assertion function"_.
A type assertion function takes in a value, throws an error if the value doesn't match an expected type, and otherwise returns the value.
When paired with a type predicate function, a type assertion function can inform TypeScript's type system that a value is an instance of a branded type.

This `asPositive` function uses `isPositive` to throw an error if the value isn't an integer.
The result is that calling code can wrap a value with `asPositive` to assert that that value is definitely a `Positive`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
type Positive = number & { __brand: "positive" };

declare function waitForSeconds(seconds: Positive): Promise<void>;

function assertPositive(value: number): asserts value is Positive {
  if (value < 0) {
    throw new Error(`${value} is not positive.`);
  }
}

let n = 123;

// Ok: the value is positive. üëç
assertPositive(n);

// Ok: the assertion changed the type to be `Positive`. üëç
waitForSeconds(n);
```

Type assertion functions can be a handy pattern for writing more succinct code with branded types.
However, they introduce a new downside of relying on throwing errors to indicate when values aren't the correct type.
[Thrown errors can't be made type-safe](./why-typescript-doesnt-include-a-throws-keyword.mdx).

As with `as` assertions, be very careful whenever using type assertion functions in TypeScript.

## Uses for Branded Types

Branded types can be helpful whenever TypeScript should be told that two seemingly-identical structures are actually different.
We‚Äôll explore two popular use-cases: branded numbers and branded strings.

### Branded Numbers

Numbers are some of the most common uses for branded types because TypeScript doesn't support numeric types more specific than `bigint` or `number`.
Existing proposals such as [Microsoft/TypeScript#54925 Numeric Range Types (Feature Update)](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/54925) are still in discussion.

Other numeric variants such as `Negative`, `NonZero`, and `Prime` on can all be represented with branded types.

Currency handling is another useful case for branded numeric types.
Applications dealing with multiple currencies might need to make sure numbers used for amounts of one currency don't accidentally get transferred to a different currency.

This code uses a generic `Currency<T>` type to set up multiple branded types for currencies.
Attempting to describe a Euro-based gyro's cost in USD results in a type error:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
type Currency<T> = number & { __currency: T };
type Euro = Currency<"euro">;
type USD = Currency<"usd">;

interface PurchasableEuro {
  cost: Euro;
  name: string;
}

const myPrice = 10 as USD;

const gyro: PurchasableEuro = {
  cost: myPrice,
  name: "euro",
};
```

:::note
Per [Microsoft/TypeScript#59423 Don't allow math operations on different branded numeric types](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/59423), binary operations on branded numeric types don't cause any type errors.
Use with caution.
:::

Branded string types can be used whenever numeric values have some characteristic that separates them from other numbers.

### Branded Strings

Other uses for branded types include decoded or sanitized text, such as user input that has been sanitized against injected code, passwords, and HTML or URL encoded characters.
Branded types can be used to enforce that un-sanitized strings aren't provided in locations that should only use sanitized strings.

This snippet shows protecting against [XSS attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) by forcing user input to be sanitized before appending to the DOM:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
type SafeString = string & { __sanitized: true };

/**
 * Removes any unsafe parts, such as <script> tags.
 */
declare function sanitize(xml: string): SafeString;

function writeToDocument(xml: SafeString) {
  document.body.innerHTML += xml;
}

const userInput = `<script src="evil.js"></script>`;

// Ok: the text is sanitized and safe for the page üëç
writeToDocument(sanitize(userInput));

// Type error: unsafe input XML üëé
writeToDocument(userInput);
```

:::note
[Writing to `innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML#replacing_the_contents_of_an_element) is a dangerous practice in general.
Treat this as an educational example, not an endorsement of insecure HTML practices.
:::

Another use for branded string types is the concept of a "guid" (Globally Unique ID) type, used by some applications to assign a unique identifier for every kind of data in their database.
GUIDs are typically represented as strings but each data type's GUID can't be used for any other data type.
Branded strings can be used to ensure GUID values for different data types aren't accidentally interchanged.

This snippet differentiates comment IDs and post IDs with branded `Guid` types:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
type Guid<DataType> = string & { __guid: DataType };

type CommentId = Guid<"comment">;
type PostId = Guid<"post">;

interface Comment {
  id: CommentId;
  // ...
}

interface Post {
  id: PostId;
  // ...
}

declare function getCommentById(id: CommentId): Promise<Comment>;
declare function getPostById(id: PostId): Promise<Post>;

async function getById(id: CommentId) {
  // Ok: the branded type matches up üëç
  await getCommentById(id);

  // Type error: mismatched comment and post üëé
  await getPostById(id);
}
```

Branded string types can be useful whenever data from different sources is stored as similar-looking strings, but shouldn't be mixed together.

## Community Libraries

Branded types aren't used in most TypeScript projects, but they are handy enough that a few community projects have sprung up to make using them easier.
`ts-brand` and Effect TS are two of the more popular ones.

### `ts-brand`

The [`ts-brand`](https://github.com/kourge/ts-brand) package provides a community-built option to share pre-written code just for type brands.
It exports a generic `Brand` type that can be used to create branded types:

```ts
import { Brand } from "ts-brand";

type Guid = Brand<string, "guid">;

const myKnownGuid = "abc123" as Guid;
```

<!--
`ts-brand` comes with several utilities around branded types.
Its `make` function notably creates a utility function that asserts a value to be a branded type.

This `asPositive` is an _"identity"_ function (one that directly returns its argument) with a return type of `Positive` instead of `number`:

```ts twoslash
import { Brand, make } from "ts-brand";

type Positive = Brand<number, "positive">;

const asPositive = make<Positive>();

const value = asPositive(42);
//    ^?
```

`make` can take in an optional [type assertion function](#type-assertion-functions) to enforce provided values match some constraint.
We can use those to enforce the constraints as part of `make`'s identity functions.

This `asPositive` throws an error if the provided number isn't greater than zero:

```ts twoslash
import { Brand, make } from "ts-brand";

type Positive = Brand<number, "positive">;

const asPositive = make<Positive>((value) => {
  if (value <= 0) {
    throw new Error(`Non-positive value: ${value}`);
  }
});

// No error thrown
asPositive(42);

// Error: Non-positive value: -1
asPositive(-1);
```

-->

See the [`ts-brand` API docs](https://github.com/kourge/ts-brand#api) for more details.

### Effect TS

[Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) is a popular framework for building type-rich TypeScript applications.
One of the many utilities it provides is a `Brand` including:

- `Brand.Brand`: a generic type that acts as the brand in a type
- `Brand.nominal`: a generic function that returns a type brand identify function

Put together, the two allow making type brands similar to `ts-brand`:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
import { Brand } from "effect";

type Positive = number & Brand.Brand<"Positive">;

const asPositive = Brand.nominal<Positive>();

let myPositive: Positive;

// Ok: the asPositive tells TypeScript we meant this. üëç
myPositive = asPositive(123);

// Type error: TypeScript doesn't know whether this is intended. üëç
myPositive = 123;
```

`Effect` also allows making a type brand assertion function.
Unlike `ts-brand`'s `make`, `Effect` provides a separate function, `Brand.refined`, that takes in two parameters:

1. A function that determines whether a value matches the type brand's constraint
2. A function to throw an error for a value that doesn't match the constraint

This `asPositive` throws an error if the provided number isn't greater than zero:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
import { Brand } from "effect";

type Positive = number & Brand.Brand<"Positive">;

const asPositive = Brand.refined<Positive>(
  (value) => value > 0,
  (value) => Brand.error(`Non-positive value: ${value}`)
);

// Ok üëç
asPositive(42);

// Error: Non-positive value: -1 üëé
asPositive(-1);
```

See [Effect's Branded Types docs](https://effect.website/docs/guides/style/branded-types) for more details.

## Alternatives to Type Brands

Type brands, as with all type system features, add complexity to code.
The benefits of type brands might not outweigh the drawback of that added complexity!

Before using type brands, think on whether they solve any actual issues you're likely to face in your application.
You might be better off with a different strategy, such as one of the following ones.

### Avoiding Type Brands Altogether

Your type system doesn't have to document every facet of your code.
In fact, no type system can fully describe all the nuances of your values.
Attempting to do so can sometimes lead to overly complex code or type definitions.
Sometimes it's easier to stick with basic type primitives and live with slightly imprecise types.

For example, in an application that operates with numeric values that must always be non-zero, it can be tempting to make a `NonZero` branded type to enforce that.
But if values are known by developers to never be zero, it might be easier to just sprinkle in an occasional assertion.

Instead of the following `NonZero` type brand and assertion functions with a `divide` function...

```ts
type NonZero = number & { __brand: "non-zero" };

function isNonZero(value: number): value is NonZero {
  return value !== 0;
}

function asNonZero(value: number): Positive {
  if (!isNonZero(value)) {
    throw new Error("Received unexpected zero.");
  }

  return value;
}

function divide(a: number, b: NonZero) {
  return asNonZero(a / b);
}

console.log(divide(12, asNonZero(3)));
```

...using a single thrown error inside `divide` results in equivalently safe and much more readable code:

```ts twoslash
function divide(a: number, b: number) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero.");
  }

  return a / b;
}

console.log(divide(12, 34));
```

When deciding whether to add branded types to your code, use your best judgement on the tradeoffs.
Branded types can help precisely describe code -- at the cost of extra verbosity.

### Unions

If a value is known to be one of a limited set of possible types, the best description for it might be a `|` union type.
Union types are made to describe a specific set of known allowed types.

As an example, take a `Task` class that stores its current status as a `status` string.
One version of the class could represent that `status` as a branded `TaskStatus` type to differentiate it from other strings:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
// This should only be: "pending", "rejected", "resolved"
type TaskStatus = string & { __brand: "status" };

class Task {
  #status: TaskStatus = "pending" as TaskStatus;

  constructor(worker: () => Promise<void>) {
    worker()
      .then(() => (this.#status = "resolved" as TaskStatus))
      .catch(() => (this.#status = "rejecting" as TaskStatus));
    //                             ~~~~~~~~~~~
    // This should be "rejected", but there is no type error. üëé
  }

  getStatus() {
    return this.#status;
  }
}
```

Cases where a value must be one of a set of known types are generally better represented by a _union_ type.
Union types are more precise for describing exactly what a value might be.

The `TaskStatus` type would be better off as a union of the three known task status strings.
Doing so would have caught the incorrect string in the previous example:

```ts twoslash
type TaskStatus = "pending" | "rejected" | "resolved";

class Task {
  #status: TaskStatus = "pending";

  constructor(worker: () => Promise<void>) {
    worker()
      .then(() => (this.#status = "resolved"))
      .catch(() => (this.#status = "rejected"));
  }

  getStatus() {
    return this.#status;
  }
}
```

Whenever a value can only be one of a set of known values, consider using a union type to represent that set.

### Enums

Another TypeScript construct for representing a known set of values is an _enum_.
Enums, enumerated type, are similar to unions in that they allow describing a set of related types under one shared name.

Unlike unions, enums are one of the few runtime syntax extensions provided by TypeScript.
Each enum declared in code becomes an object.
Values under the enum are referred to under the enum's name -- both when used as a type and when as a runtime value.

The `TaskStatus` example could be written with an `enum TaskStatus`:

```ts twoslash
enum TaskStatus {
  Pending = "pending",
  Rejected = "rejected",
  Resolved = "resolved",
}

class Task {
  #status = TaskStatus.Pending;

  constructor(worker: () => Promise<void>) {
    worker()
      .then(() => (this.#status = TaskStatus.Resolved))
      .catch(() => (this.#status = TaskStatus.Rejected));
  }

  getStatus() {
    return this.#status;
  }
}
```

Enums are a bit contentious to some TypeScript developers.
They add new runtime code that may eventually conflict with later versions of JavaScript, such as if the [TC39 Enums Proposal](https://github.com/rbuckton/proposal-enum) is ever ratified.
On the one hand, they can be useful for having a set of types and values under a shared name.

### Template Literal Types

TypeScript allows types describing general patterns of strings called _template literal types_.
These types are handy when a string must match some pattern, but it'd be cumbersome to write out all permutations of that pattern in a union or enum.

The following `ThemeStore` class uses a branded string type named `Theme` to represent its themes.
However, `Theme` doesn't enforce any pattern for the contents, even though the code comment suggests it should be a specific shape of string:

```ts twoslash
// This should only be two components, joined by a "-":
// 1. Base visual: "dark", "light", or "system"
// 2. Contrast level: "high", "low", or "standard"
type Theme = string & { __brand: "theme" };

class ThemeStore {
  #theme: Theme;

  constructor(theme: Theme) {
    this.#theme = theme;
  }

  getTheme() {
    return this.#theme;
  }

  setTheme(theme: Theme) {
    this.#theme = theme;
  }
}

const store = new ThemeStore("dark-standard" as Theme);

store.setTheme("dark-high" as Theme);

store.setTheme("dark-regular" as Theme);
//             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// This should be "dark-standard", but there is no type error. üëé
```

Switching `Theme` to a template literal string allows TypeScript to give a type error when a string of the wrong pattern is provided:

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
type ThemeBase = "dark" | "light" | "system";
type ThemeContrast = "high" | "low" | "standard";
type Theme = `${ThemeBase}-${ThemeContrast}`;

class ThemeStore {
  #theme: Theme;

  constructor(theme: Theme) {
    this.#theme = theme;
  }

  getTheme() {
    return this.#theme;
  }

  setTheme(theme: Theme) {
    this.#theme = theme;
  }
}

const store = new ThemeStore("dark-standard");

store.setTheme("dark-high");

store.setTheme("dark-regular");
```

Whenever strings are guaranteed to match a particular format, template literal types can be a precise tool for describing their format in the type system.

### Wrappers

Instead of using primitive values directly, another strategy shift can be to
For example, this snippet [courtesy of Chris Krycho](https://github.com/LearningTypeScript/site/pull/135#pullrequestreview-2206383164) shows a dedicated class with a static `of` method for creating and storing validated positive numbers:

```ts
class Positive {
  readonly value: number;

  private constructor(value: number) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  static of(value: number): Positive | Error {
    return value > 0
      ? new this(value)
      : new Error(`Non-positive number: ${value}`);
  }
}

Positive.of(123); // Positive { value: 123 }
Positive.of(-1); // Error { message: "Non-positive number: -1" }
```

Wrapper types such as that `Positive` class can be very useful when you need the utmost safety in creating and validating numbers.
However, they add overhead -both conceptually and at runtime- for every time they're used.
Consider saving them for only the cases when you absolutely need the utmost safety in your code.

## Closing Thoughts

Branded types are a nifty trick in the type system for differentiating structurally identical types from each other.
They have quite a few use cases that can help increase program safety.

However, they come with the cost of increased conceptual complexity for working with your code.
Whether you're writing your own branded types, onboarding a community library, or opting for an alternative strategy instead, you've got options for using types to precisely describe the characteristics of your values.
